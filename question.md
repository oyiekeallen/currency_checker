## Focus Mobile Backend Take Home Challenge Question 1
Cheap Stocks, Inc is looking to build a cheap command line application centered around stocks that will be used by users in Africa. They are unsure of all the details now but they know they would like to support internationalization by allowing data to be displayed using supported currencies. The company has uploaded a CSV file of supported currencies to their server which can be accessed at: https://focusmobile-interview-materials.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Cheap.Stocks.Internationalization.Currencies.csv. 
The company would like you to build a command line application that takes in currency (using ISO 4217 code) as an argument and displays whether or not the currency is supported in the application.
The company will be making updates to the documents so your application should use the latest info to display the proper information to the user. Your assignment is to design and implement a functional MVP to the specifications listed.

### Specifications
To guide you with building the MVP, here is a list of detailed specifications from Cheap Stocks, Inc. The command line application you design and implement should follow these guidelines.
CLI application that takes in an input flag corresponding to the input currency
Handle user input errors gracefully
Provide a help menu





### What to submit
Complete the design and code as defined to the best of your abilities
Place notes in your code to help with clarity where appropriate. Make it readable enough to present to the Focus Mobile interview team
Include a README with instructions on how to build/run your application
Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab link to your repository containing the code
Send the git repo link to jobs@focusmobile.co

### What we are looking for?
Did you follow the instructions for submission?
Is your code organized?
Were models/entities and other components easily identifiable to the reviewer?
Did you separate any concerns in your application? Why or why not?
Does your solution use appropriate data types for the problem as described?
Did you add comments to clarify any possibly confusing code?
Complete solutions aren't required, but what you do submit needs to run.

### Final note
As stated, complete solutions are not required. However, whatever you submit should be functional. This is not a pass or fail test. Instead, it will serve as an evaluation tool.
Good luck!
